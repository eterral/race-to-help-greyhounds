## Project Description

Race To Help Greyhounds is built to help people rescue greyhounds either through adoption from a local rescue or trying to end racing in your location. The app displays locations and information to find a rescue and will have contact information to reach out to your representive if you would like to help end racing.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    {
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "reczZXvpn1U0Fbxkn",
            "fields": {
                "name": "Greyhound Adoption League of Texas",
                "website": "http://www.galtx.org/",
                "state": "Texas",
                "contact": "https://www.facebook.com/GALTX/?ref=ts"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-12-02T02:31:23.000Z"
        }
    ]
}
```


#### MVP 

- Build a single page APP with React
- Use Airtable to create two different tables storing information on rescues and racetracks
- Render the data to the app grabbing the data via axios
- Allow users to add Rescues to the database via axios


#### PostMVP  

- Add International rescues/tracls
- Render maps showing rescue locations
- Display a random greyhound for adoption

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
Axios, React, and functional coding. Logic has always been a strength of mine through the course and React has only improved it.

### Weaknesses:
Styling/CSS. I have continued to have a rough time going into styling knowing how I want to execute it.

### Opportunities:
Using libraries to help with styling

### Threats:
Getting distracted with trying to perfect the style. Trying to add Post-MVP features
